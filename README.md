As I was not so familiar with TypeScript, that's why I decided to read the documentation first before writing the code.
Then I installed all the required packages needed for the application.
After installing all the packages, I made the server.ts file in the backend folder and connected MongoDb to the server.
I decided to use MongoDb for the database as I have already worked with it before.
Then I made a controller folder in the backend and created a file, taskController.ts, in which I created all the functions needed for the CRUD API to work properly.
Similarly, I created a routes folder and added the file, taskRoutes.ts, in which I added the routes for the APIs to perform.
Then I tested my APIs using Postman.

After Completing the backend, I started with the frontend using React and connected the backend with it using Redux.
